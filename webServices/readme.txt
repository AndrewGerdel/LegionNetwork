WebServices refer to the API endpoints exposed by each node.  They extend functionality to external applications, allowing
messages to be sent or data to be retrieved.

This is different than the services defined in the WebSocket folder.  These are used for node-to-node communication, such 
as registration, message broadcasts, block broadcasts, etc.
